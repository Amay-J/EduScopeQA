> **ðŸ“ˆ Summary**: 2,405 total questions across 3 academic domains â€¢ 1.18M+ words of university-level content

### Key Features
- **2,405 total question-answer pairs** across three academic domains
- **1.18+ million words** of realistic academic materials
- **Source texts not included** - use provided download script to obtain materials

### Question Types (by scope)

1. **Specific Questions**: Narrow queries answerable from a single paragraph (~500 words)
   - Example: *"Which genera of soil bacteria are involved in the denitrification process?"*

2. **Sectional Questions**: Require information synthesis across multiple paragraphs (~5,000 words)
   - Example: *"How did President Wilson's personality affect the Paris Peace Conference outcome?"*

3. **Thematic Questions**: Broad queries requiring understanding of overarching themes
   - Example: *"What does the Whaleman's Chapel represent in Moby Dick's narrative?"*

## Purpose

This dataset addresses gaps in educational AI evaluation by:

- **Testing pedagogical variations**: Comparing performance across disciplines and question complexity
- **Realistic educational content**: Using actual course materials rather than Wikipedia or news articles
- **Multi-granularity evaluation**: Assessing both factual recall and thematic understanding

## Obtaining Source Materials

The original source texts are not included in this repository. Instead, we provide a download script (`download_sources.py`) that fetches the publicly available materials from their original sources:

- **History texts**: 6 historical works from Project Gutenberg (public domain)
- **Literature works**: 2 classic novels from Project Gutenberg (public domain)
- **Science textbook**: OpenStax Microbiology textbook (openly licensed)

All Project Gutenberg and OpenStax materials are freely available.

Run the download script to automatically retrieve and organize the source materials:

```bash
# Install required dependencies
pip install requests PyPDF2

# Run the download script
python download_sources.py
```

The script will:
1. Create the appropriate directory structure
2. Download all texts from Project Gutenberg (history and literature)
3. Download the OpenStax Microbiology PDF and convert it to text format
4. Organize all materials into the correct input directories

**Note**: If PDF conversion fails, you can manually download the OpenStax Microbiology textbook and convert it using tools like Adobe Acrobat, online PDF converters, or alternative Python libraries like `pdfplumber`.
